<h1>CRAZY LIFE OF TREVOR</h1>
   <p>One of the comedy world's brightest new voices, Trevor Noah is a light-footed but sharp-minded observer of the absurdities of politics, race and identity, sharing jokes and insights drawn from the wealth of experience acquired in his relatively young life. Trevor Noah becomes comic in different parts of his stories in his book ‘Born a crime’. He starts with the aspect that he is born in a mixed race family. His father Robert was a Swiss and his mother was Patricia Nombuyiselo who is a Xhosa.</p>

<p>The novel is comic in various parts of the story. It starts off with a high note when Trevor Noah is thrown off from a moving car by his mother Patricia and he is only nine years old. His mother now expects him to run so fast for his dear life. His mother on the other hand take Andrew and curls herself around him and she leaps out behind Trevor Noah. This shows a very daring human as opposed to a normal mother. Obviously a normal mother would not think of, leave alone daring to throw a child off a moving car. 
This also goes too far when Trevor narrates that his mother Patricia is the initiator of him being born. He forces Robert at least if he does not want a child he should just donate his sperm. Sounding so convincing she convinces him and finally when she gives birth to the big baby ’Trevor’ in Hillbrow Hospital it turns out that he is a very light-skinned baby. It forces his mother to lie to the doctors that Trevor’s father is from Swaziland. While most children are a proof of their parent’s love he is a proof of his parent’s criminality.</p>

<p>It is also happens that Trevor has his grandfather Temperance Noah who once when his mood swings were against every one he had his fists circling around Trevor. Threatening him that he is still a man and could fight. He was a boxer in his youthful age so he still thinks he can fight the way he used to. Here Trevor is only eight years old. Also using common sense he could not fight an old man. It against the African norms.
It is also very naïve of Trevor to think that he can pray for the food and poison will be taken away. His mother keeps having this notion that they can not eat at Temperance’s second family home, the food is poisoned. Though it is normal for an African mindset and polygamous family.</p>


<p>Evidently in BORN A CRIME it is all about humor and adventure as seen in this part that Trevor is left with his Koko.Koko is Trevor’s great grandmother who has poor eyesight. He is left reading and then suddenly he feels like going out. Checking outside it is pouring down heavily. He thinks of how he is going to be drained and soaked. Suddenly, an idea struck his mind. He takes a newspaper and lays on the kitchen floor,takes down his pants and starts shitting. He describes vividly of how he feels so revealed. He also says shitting brings back humans to earth and gives each one humility. Trevor states that Beyoncé shits, The Pope shits and to add on that The Queen of England also shits. So shitting is normal.</p>

<p>There is also this instance where Trevor and family move to Eden Park. No sooner had they settled for a pet they bought two cats. They were not only cats but black cats. In a black society owning a black cat was always a sign that you are a witch but they had moved to colored neighbourhood. Though after sometime they found one time the cats strung up by their tails. They were gutted and skinned, their heads chopped off. On the front wall someone had written in Afrikaans ‘Heks’ meaning witches. So colored people were not any different from black people. 
So Trevor gets a dog named Fufi and his mother’s is named panther. It is later noticed that Fufi is deaf as he was not as intelligent as Panther. So one day Trevor remains behind and sees Fufi scaling up the wall and goes to the neighbourhood. Trevor decides to follow Fufi only to find him many streets past home. He finds a young boy and the boy calls Fufi, Spotty. The colored young boy starts claiming Fufi is his own. This goes to an extent that Trevor has to bring along his mother and panther as a witness. Unfortunately it happened that the colored boy was set that the dog belongs to him. Funny enough Patricia, Trevor’s mother has to buy Fufi though Fufi belonged to them. It is so funny that poor Trevor sobs because he thinks Fufi loves another boy.</p>

<p>Purpose to read BORN A CRIME, it is a very fascinating book. There is more to what I have written about Trevor Noah.</p>
